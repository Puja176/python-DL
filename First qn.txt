1.)If we are porting our code or executing the python 3 code in python 2, integer division changes go unnoticed (since it doesn’t raise any error). It is preferred to use the floating value (like 7.0/5 or 7/5.0) to get the expected result when porting our code.
for example:
print 7 / 5
print -7 / 5    
  
 
Output in Python 2
1 
-2 
Output in Python 3.
1.4 
-1.4 

2.)This is the most well known change. In this the print function in Python 2 is replaced by print() function in Python 3,i.e, to print in Python 3.x an extra pair of parenthesis is required.

print 'Hello, Geeks'    (Pyhton 2)  
print('Hope You like these facts') (Python 3)
